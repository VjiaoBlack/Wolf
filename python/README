README for python stuff, which hasn't been linked into the rest of the project
Since the pathfinding is pretty complicated, I thought C would be too messy.

This program has its own independent map generation and rendering system.

It creates a Map object from a .map file.

A Pather object can be constructed from a Map object. This object creates waypoints on the ends of each wall in the map. It constructs a complete graph from these and then removes edges that intersect a wall. Floyd-Warshall is then performed on this graph and the results are saved to instance variables so that they may be used later.

The renderer has capability to draw maps, graphs, or paths. The graphics close upon clicking on the window.

Geom is a bunch of geometric helper functions.
